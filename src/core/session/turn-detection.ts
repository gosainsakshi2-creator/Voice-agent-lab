/**
 * turn-detection.ts
 *
 * Adaptive end-of-turn ("endpointing") detection for the streaming
 * pipeline. The platform's `TranscriptSegment` shape only exposes
 * per-segment timing (`startedAtMs`/`endedAtMs`) and an `isFinal`
 * flag — there is no raw audio-energy/VAD signal in this
 * architecture (see `AudioPayload`, which is deliberately opaque
 * bytes). This detector works with the signal that IS available:
 * the gap between successive transcript segments.
 *
 * A fixed silence timeout either cuts off slow, thoughtful speakers
 * or feels sluggish for fast, clipped speakers. This detector starts
 * at a sensible default and nudges its threshold toward the user's
 * own observed inter-utterance pause length as the call progresses,
 * within safe bounds — the "adaptive turn detection" requirement.
 *
 * On top of the silence timer it also looks at WHAT was said, not
 * just how long the caller has been quiet. A short pause after
 * "...aur mujhe" or "...because" is a caller mid-thought, not a
 * finished turn, and replying there is the most common way a voice
 * agent ends up talking over the user. Those pauses get a bounded
 * extra grace window; a pause after a complete clause endpoints at
 * the normal threshold, so finished turns still get a fast reply.
